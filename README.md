# D&D Beyond PrettyPring

## Prettier printing for your resources on D&D Beyond

A minimalistic extension which makes paper and PDF prints from D&D Beyond a little prettier.

Mostly just by removing redundant or annoying elements from the printed page, as well as redistributing some space and moving a few things around.

At the moment, all images are hidden (work in progress).
